# Turning 25: February Review & March Goals

February was another exciting month. It started with some of the work things that took a lot of my time. Maybe I will be able to talk about it at some point, but not now.

I had my 25th birthday on the 7th of February as well. It was lockdown in Germany so I did not have a party or something. But yeah, I can start my quarter-life crisis now. That is how it works, right?

Anyway, because of these things, I was not able to focus a lot outside of work on side projects and similar, but I have done some things that I will reflect on in this post and also put out my goals for the next month.

## February Review

### Blog articles on this blog

- Goal: Create 2 blog articles on this blog
- Status: 2/2 âœ…

I am quite happy with the progress that happened on this page at least. Blogging does not require a big attention span, so I was still able to write some things. I released The Work Experience in a Software Engineer Resume and The Best Tech Companies in Berlin 2021. The first article is the continuation of my bigger series around writing good resumes as a software engineer. In my career, I have reviewed dozens of interviews and created many that landed people jobs at different bigger companies. From time to time I also give reviews to external people and help where I can. My personal goal for this: Bring everyone forward with their goals. The resume should not be the limiting factor. The second blog article did not go viral yet, but I created a Reddit post that went viral on the r/cscareerquestionsEU subreddit. With a little bit of marketing and backlink tracking, I could probably grow this blog article a bit.
